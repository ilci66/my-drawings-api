* I will be deploying this api to heroku probably, to use in the future
* Also planning on updating it regularly with my new drawings
* Don't wanna use graphql in this one, couldn't find a solution for the error I ran into at on my last project (react native threw an error I couldn't find a solution for) 
* I have read a lot about "pg" directly and used it in my last project so I will use "sequalize" in this one to learn about it
* Commenting the examples given in the docs, taking my notes
* Changed the table names in the database instead of just using { freezeTableName: true } in sequelize options

* Planning on posting the images on imgur and storing the urls in my database where I will be creating relations 
* Reading about associations, sequelize seems really cool, taking notes with pen and paper while
