* I will be deploying this api to heroku probably, to use in the future
* Also planning on updating it regularly with my new drawings
* Don't wanna use graphql in this one, couldn't find a solution for the error I ran into at on my last project (react native threw an error I couldn't find a solution for) 
* I have read a lot about "pg" directly and used it in my last project so I will use "sequalize" in this one to learn about it
* As I'm actually planning on using this in the future as well I wanna make it production ready, so learning about transctions now as it's not included by default
*  reading about to fix the error Babel env preset
